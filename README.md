# Android MVVM User List Fetch

This Android project showcases the implementation of MVVM architecture to fetch and display a list of users from an API. MVVM is a design pattern that separates the user interface (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model) layers of an application.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: Follows the MVVM architecture pattern for separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Retrofit for API Communication**: Utilizes Retrofit library for making API requests and handling responses.
- **ViewModel and LiveData**: Uses ViewModel and LiveData to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **RecyclerView**: Displays the list of users using a RecyclerView component.
- **Error Handling**: Implements error handling for network requests and displays appropriate error messages to the user.
